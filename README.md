# Tic-Tac-Toe Game ðŸŽ®

## Overview
This project is a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It allows two players to compete against each other on a 3x3 grid, with the first player to get three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) winning the game. This project showcases my understanding of basic game logic, DOM manipulation, and user interaction handling.

## Features
- **Two-Player Mode**: Play against another player on the same device.
- **Interactive Interface**: Click on a cell to place your mark (X or O).
- **Win Detection**: Automatically checks for a win or draw after each move.
- **Game Reset**: Reset the game board to play again.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the game board and interface elements.
- **CSS**: Styling of the game board and visual indicators.
- **JavaScript**: Game logic, event handling, and win/draw detection.

## How to Play
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Brukti-23/tic-tac-toe.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd tic-tac-toe
   ```
3. **Open `index.html`** in your web browser.
4. **Game Rules**:
   - Player 1 is 'X' and Player 2 is 'O'.
   - Take turns clicking on an empty cell to place your mark.
   - The first player to align three marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.
   - If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
5. **Reset**: Click the "Reset" button to start a new game.

## Insights
This project was a fantastic opportunity to implement basic game mechanics and user interactions using JavaScript. It reinforced my understanding of conditional statements, event listeners, and DOM manipulation. The experience also helped me appreciate the importance of clean and efficient code structure in game development.

## Future Enhancements
- **AI Opponent**: Implement a single-player mode where users can play against an AI with different difficulty levels.
- **Score Tracking**: Add functionality to keep track of player scores over multiple rounds.
- **Improved UI**: Enhance the visual design with animations and sound effects.
